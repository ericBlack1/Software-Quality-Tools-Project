## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **pip**: Python package installer
- **Git**: To clone the repository

You can check the installed versions by running the following commands:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
git --version
```

## Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Go to the [repository URL](https://github.com/ericBlack1/Software-Quality-Tools-Project).
2. Click on the **Fork** button (top-right corner) to fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
3. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/<Your-github-name>/Software-Quality-Tools-Project.git
   ```

4. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Software-Quality-Tools-Project
   ```

## Installation

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - On **Windows**:
   
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On **Mac/Linux**:
   
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
